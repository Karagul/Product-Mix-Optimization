    "because these models are going to be changed after this month, the company doesnâ€™t want\n",

    "Basics and 1200 XPs. Each Basic sells for \\\\$300 and each XP sells for \\\\$450. The cost of\n",
    "component parts for a Basic is \\\\$150; for an XP it is \\\\$225. Labor is required for assembly\n",
    "and testing. There are at most 10,000 assembly hours and 3000 testing hours available. Each\n",
    "labor hour for assembling costs \\\\$11 and each labor hour for testing costs \\\\$15. Each Basic\n",
    "requires five hours for assembling and one hour for testing, and each XP requires six hours\n",
    "for assembling and two hours for testing. PC Tech wants to know how many of each model\n",
    "it should produce (assemble and test) to maximize its net profit, but it cannot use more labor\n",
    "hours than are available, and it does not want to produce more than it can sell."
